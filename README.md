# Mars Terrain Semantic Segmentation
The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for semantic segmentation of 64Ã—128 grayscale images representing Martian terrain. The network is designed to classify each pixel into one of five categories: Background, Soil, Bedrock, Sand, and Big Rock. This segmentation facilitates detailed analysis of the Martian surface by distinguishing key terrain features.
